# hello-world

Hi there!

I like web. I often play with my friend PHP when I have nothing to do.

PHP rocks beacuse he is easy to understand for a beginner like me but yeah, he gets a little troublesome when the project becomes bigger. Still, we are friends and I've never left him for other chicks like RubyOnRails.

I know some extent of html css js jquery json ajax php mysql and java.
